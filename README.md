## Kay Dent

A Software Developer trained at Makers Academy. My background in the creative and education industries makes me an excellent communicator and team player.  I love solving problems, discovering new things, and the little fizz of satisfaction when the code finally passes your test.

## Skills

**Fast (and positive) Learner** - I learnt the violin as an adult: I'm not afraid of struggling with something to begin with and believe very strongly that if I can't do it now, then at some point I will be able to. Pretty much, I love learning! (And now I love playing the violin too). 
As a fast learner, I'm able to pick up new code and concepts very quickly - during my Makers bootcamp, I established a working knowledge of Javascript within a week - making me an adaptable, resilient and highly trainable software developer.

**Excellent communicator** - I've performed to large and small audiences; taught adults and children; and collaborated with many different teams to make shows, including as a director and as a deviser. The key thing I've taken from all this is that communicating effectively is about listening and that effective leadership is about making sure that everyone in the team is heard and feels respected. 
This makes me well suited to software development teams of all sizes. In my Makers experience, the main barriers we faced in group work were about communication, not technical blockers, and I believe my willingness to engage constructively, kindly and respectfully was a meaningful contribution to overall group cohesion..

**Versatile** - I maintained a full time career teaching across different subjects and ages, while running my own theatre company putting on 2+ shows a year; I was in the fortunate position to be able to to take the pandemic as an opportunity, and produced some of my best work at this time (including a digital experience combining guided meditation, theatre and originally composed music).
