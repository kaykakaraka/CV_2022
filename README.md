  A Software Developer trained at Makers Academy. My background in the creative and education industries makes me an excellent communicator and team player.  I love solving problems, discovering new things, and the little fizz of satisfaction when the code finally passes your test.  

  My first spark of interest in tech came when I was working on a digital theatre show/experience, which was in the form of a guided meditation and included originally composed music. I was responsible for running the tech, and coordinate the various sound software. I found I was fascinated by how this worked and got a great satisfaction out of things coming together. It was the first step towards me realising the creative nature of all tech, and I feel excited for the possibility of working on software that people really want to use, and will be grateful for, like I was.

## Skills  

**Fast (and positive) Learner** - I learnt the violin as an adult: I'm not afraid of struggling with something to begin with and believe very strongly that if I can't do it now, then at some point I will be able to. Pretty much, I love learning! (And now I love playing the violin too).  
  
As a fast learner, I'm able to pick up new code and concepts very quickly - during my Makers bootcamp, I established a working knowledge of Javascript within a week - making me an adaptable, resilient and highly trainable software developer.

**Excellent communicator** - I've performed to large and small audiences; taught adults and children; and collaborated with many different teams to make shows, including as a director and as a deviser. The key thing I've taken from all this is that communicating effectively is about listening and that effective leadership is about making sure that everyone in the team is heard and feels respected.  
  
This makes me well suited to software development teams of all sizes. In my Makers experience, the main barriers we faced in group work were about communication, not technical blockers, and I believe my willingness to engage constructively, kindly and respectfully was a meaningful contribution to overall group cohesion.

**Versatile** - I maintained a full time career teaching across different subjects and ages, while running my own theatre company putting on 2+ shows a year; I was in the fortunate position to be able to to take the pandemic as an opportunity, and produced some of my best work at this time (including a digital experience combining guided meditation, theatre and originally composed music).  
  
My versatility means I'm able to deal with the multiple, sometimes apparently conflicting, demands within software engineering, and adapt quickly to new tech stacks. Having worked as a freelancer also means I have a good understanding of business more generally, including the need to make tech that has real-world implementation, explaining my work to others, and balancing competitive quality (sometime perfectionism!) with delivering in a timely way.
